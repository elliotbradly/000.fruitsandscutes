wolves , null : [Wolves] ([Lupus]) are the origin of the [domestic dog] ([lupus] familaris)
 	 . They are in the same family as foxes,
 	 [coyotes] 
 	 and dingoes 
 	 but they are a lot rarer after farms were created
 	 . Once [wolves] lived with humans,
 	 helping them to hunt 
 	 and [guarding] property,
 	 they became the hunted once farmers domesticated animals onto farms 
 	 and found wolves to be a threat to their livestock
 	 . 

The [timber wolf],
 	 the native wolf became extinct in Britain in1680 (Although some stories indicate that the last wolf was killed in [1743] 
 	 but this is unlikely as one wolf cannot live for 63 years) 
 	 and recent reintroduction schemes have also failed in the Scottish [moors]
 	 . Britain is not the only place to be killing wolves off
 	 . America has pushed the once wide spread population of wolves through out the States back to ranges in Alaska,
 	 Idaho,
 	 Montana,
 	 Michigan,
 	 Minnesota,
 	 Wisconsin,
 	 Wyoming,
 	 
 	 and Canada
 	 . Wolves are also suffering in the eastern world except in Russia 
 	 and [Siberia] where numbers are constant
 	 .

Wolves have a pack system that every wolf in the world seems to abide by; the alpha pair eats first 
 	 and always lead the pack when relocating
 	 . [The beta] pair step in to the alpha‚Äôs position if something happens to the male or both of the wolves,
 	 they eat second 
 	 and act as protectors for the alpha whilst they eat 
 	 and put any wolf challenging the alpha back in line
 	 . The last of all of is [the omega],
 	 this wolf is very timed 
 	 and acts as a look out whilst the other wolves are eating 
 	 and when they leave,
 	 they may eat the remains (usually stomach content
 	 .) 

Wolves tend to hunt 
 	 and feed on rabbits,
 	 [elk],
 	 deer 
 	 and sometimes on buffalo 
 	 and moose
 	 . There has never been a report of a wolf that had not been suffering from health issue attacking a human,
 	 if wolves see a human they will always run
 	 . However,
 	 there have been reports of wolves eating humans that have died of other causes
 	 .

 	 . With some of the highest real estate taxes in the state,
